      <h1>ParkigTix</h1>
   
  <p>This is our final group project from our bootcamp at Dev academy. 
  An app that automatically contests parking tickets on behalf of the user.
</p>
<p>We have all been stung by those pesky parking fines but not always had the will to appeal it. Using parkingTix the user can upload a dispute, the app will appeal on the user's behalf until the dispute is resolved. User can access and track progress of their appeal/s along with the running total of savings from the 'wins'.</p>
<p> New piece of Tech we used were OpenAI chat completions api and Gmail api to generate and send appeal emails, material UI for the seamless presenation of the app along with our bootcamp learning of React, Redux, Auth0 and databases.</p>
